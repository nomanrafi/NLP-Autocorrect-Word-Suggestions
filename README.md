# NLP-Autocorrect-Word-Suggestions
## Leveraging Jaccard Similarity for Contextual Autocorrect and Word Suggestions with Natural Language Processing.

**Project Overview:** <br>
This project aims to develop an intelligent autocorrect and word suggestion system utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging Jaccard similarity, the system provides contextual corrections and suggestions that enhance typing accuracy and efficiency, making it a valuable tool for users in various applications.

**Key Features:**
- Autocorrect Functionality: Automatically identifies and corrects misspelled words using Jaccard similarity, which measures the overlap of character sequences between the input and a predefined vocabulary.
- Word Suggestions: Generates relevant word suggestions based on user input, prioritizing options by their frequency in the dataset, thereby improving user experience and typing speed.
- Contextual Awareness: Uses character-based similarity to ensure that suggestions are not only similar but also contextually relevant to the user's input.

**Technical Details:**
- Natural Language Processing: Implements NLP techniques to process and analyze text data, enabling efficient word identification and frequency calculation.
- Data Processing: The system reads a corpus of text, processes it to generate a vocabulary set, and calculates word frequencies to establish probabilities for suggestions.
- Similarity Measurement: Employs Jaccard similarity to compare the input word with words in the vocabulary, allowing the system to identify closely related words based on character similarities.
- User Input Handling: Designed to dynamically handle various user inputs, providing real-time suggestions and corrections as the user types.


**Implementation Steps:**<br>
Data Preparation:
- Load a text corpus for analysis.
- Process the text to create a list of words and compute their frequencies.
Jaccard Similarity Calculation:
- Implement a function to compute the Jaccard similarity between the input word and words in the vocabulary.
Autocorrect and Suggestion Functions:
- Develop functions to handle autocorrecting misspelled words and providing contextual word suggestions based on user input.
User Interaction:
- Create an interface for users to input text and receive corrections and suggestions in real-time.


**Usage:**<br>
To use the system, simply input a word that you suspect may be misspelled or type a word to receive suggestions. The system will return either a confirmation of the correct spelling or a list of potential corrections and suggestions.

**Future Enhancements:**<br>- User Feedback Integration: Incorporate mechanisms to allow users to provide feedback on suggestions, enhancing the model's learning process.
- Contextual Language Models: Explore integrating more advanced NLP techniques, such as neural networks, to improve the contextual awareness of suggestions.
- Mobile Application Development: Create a mobile app interface for easier accessibility and real-time autocorrect features.
